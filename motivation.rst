
Motivation
==========

A major motivation for the developers of the cpp-netlib was that there appeared
to be no high quality, modern C++ networking library available.  Several
projects provide a lot of the functionality that's demanded, among which
include:

  * libcurl [#]_
  * C++ Sockets Library [#]_
  * Necko [#]_
  * Qt [#]_

Each of these has it's own disadvantages.

With the advent of Boost.Asio [#]_ it was felt possible to start a project 
leveraging it's capibilities to provide an application layer level library.
