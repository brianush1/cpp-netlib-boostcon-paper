For more background on cpp-netlib, the documentation that comes with the library
(and the latest at http://cpp-netlib.github.com/) is currently the best source
of information.

For more information on template metaprogramming, the book by David Abrahams and
Aleksey Gurtovoy is by far the best resource on the subject. You can get more
information about the book on its official home page at http://www.boostpro.com/mplbook/.
